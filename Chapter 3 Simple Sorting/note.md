## How Would You Do It?
As a human being, you can see all the data at once, and you can pick out the heightest data almost instantly. You don't need to laboriously measure and compare everyone.

A computer program isn't able to glance over the data in this way.

The three algorithms in this chapter all involve two steps, executed over and over until the data is sorted.
1. Compare two items.
2. Swap two items, or copy one item.
